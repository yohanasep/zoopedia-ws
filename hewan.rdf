        Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on
        the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the
        clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term "shark" has also been
        (incorrectly) used to refer to extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii, which are technically outside the
        Selachimorpha clade. Notable examples of improper classification include Cladoselache, Xenacanthus, and various
        other members of the Chondrichthyes class like the holocephalid eugenedontidans. </animal:comment>

        Cladoselache, Xenacanthus, and various other members of the Chondrichthyes class like
        the holocephalid eugenedontidans. Under this broader definition, the earliest known
        sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago. Acanthodians are often referred to
        as "spiny sharks"; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper, they are a
        paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole. Since then, sharks have
        diversified into over 500 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark
        (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to
        the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately
        12 metres (40 ft) in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000
        metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few known
        exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be found in both seawater and
        freshwater. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and
        parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.
        Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain.
        Select examples include the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark,
        and hammerhead shark. Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark
        populations are threatened by human activities. Since 1970, shark populations have been reduced
        by 71%, mostly from overfishing.

        Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder.
        Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed
        or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are
        important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many
        Auchenipteridae) are crepuscular or diurnal (most Loricariidae or Callichthyidae, for example).

        Cypriniformes. It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most
        popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released into the wild have become an invasive pest in
        parts of North America. Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively small member of
        the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It was
        first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000 years ago, and several
        distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape,
        fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown,
        and black are known).

        Stingrays are a group of sea rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are classified in the
        suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill
        stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae
        (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays) and Myliobatidae (eagle
        rays).There are about 220 known stingray species organized into 29 genera. </animal:comment>

        (eagle rays).There are about 220 known stingray species organized into 29 genera. Stingrays
        are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some
        species, such as the thorntail stingray (Dasyatis thetidis), are found in warmer temperate
        oceans and others, such as the deepwater stingray (Plesiobatis daviesi), are found in the
        deep ocean. The river stingrays and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray
        (Fontitrygon garouaensis)) are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal
        (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray
        and the eagle rays, are pelagic. Stingray species are progressively becoming threatened or
        vulnerable to extinction, particularly as the consequence of unregulated fishing. As of 2013,
        45 species have been listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. The status of some other
        species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.

        Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty
        species of clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion.
        In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species, anemonefish are
        overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can

        in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. Koi is an informal name for the colored
        variants of C. rubrofuscus kept for ornamental purposes. There are many varieties
        of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata, Japan in the
        early 19th century. Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese, distinguished
        by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black,
        red, orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and
        silver-white ('platinum') scales. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke,
        which is made up of the Kōhaku, Taishō Sanshoku and Shōwa Sanshoku varieties.

        the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding
        water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the
        fastest-swimming pelagic fish – the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to
        75 km/h (47 mph). Greatly inflated speeds can be found in early scientific reports and are still
        widely reported in the popular literature. Found in warm seas, the tuna is commercially fished
        extensively as a food fish, and is popular as a game fish. As a result of overfishing, some tuna
        species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are threatened with extinction.

        gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including
        ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also
        uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some
        waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only
        known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and
        their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose
        members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA
        evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically
        around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all
        non-avian dinosaurs. Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of
        culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such
        behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird
        species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time,
        sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with
        many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which
        are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most
        birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Many species of birds are economically important
        as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds
        being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets.
        Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to
        130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.
        Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them.
        Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry. (

        widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in
        2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to
        chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature. Genetic studies have pointed to
        multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in
        the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India,
        the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird
        that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
        annals of Thutmose III. They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC. In 2011 a study in genetic and
        archaeological evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is from Southeast Asia.

        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
        domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
        relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the
        development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
        domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
        canids. The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
        physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such
        as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
        aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine
        bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's
        best friend".

        ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. The cat is similar in
        anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable
        claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication
        includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific
        body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular,
        i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as
        those made by mice and other small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones. Female domestic cats can
        have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats
        are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of
        cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted
        in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile
        species. It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
        around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in
        Western Asia around 7500 BC. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in
        the world. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million
        cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a
        cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.

        the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist
        in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and
        concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Elephants are scattered
        throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including
        savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible.
        They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a
        fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live
        in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The
        groups, which do not include bulls, are usually led by the oldest cow, known as the matriarch. Males (bulls)
        leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly
        interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression
        known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the
        centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can
        live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound
        and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and
        cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members.
        African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as Critically
        Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant
        populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild
        elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in
        Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or
        exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art,
        folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small

        Guinea. The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest
        areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013. As with the terms "wallaroo" and "wallaby",
        "kangaroo" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. All three terms refer to members of the same taxonomic
        family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called
        "kangaroos" and the smallest are generally called "wallabies". The term "wallaroos" refers to species of an
        intermediate size. There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical
        rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region. This kind of
        kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees. A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could
        be: * wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest
        of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg; * tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's
        tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg
        (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg
        (18–33 lb); * wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smaller of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and
        weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females; * kangaroos: a large male can be 2
        m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb). Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for
        leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch
        called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development. Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo
        has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals. </animal:detail>

        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
        terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species,
        Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight
        extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological
        measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. The giraffe's chief
        distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted
        coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi.
        Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to
        Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and
        flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot
        reach. Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of
        related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may
        gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck
        is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for raising
        the young. The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has
        often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for
        Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former
        range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate
        there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

        North America and occasionally become paedomorphic. Neither should they
        be confused with mudpuppies (Necturus spp.), fully aquatic salamanders
        from a different family that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a

        urbanization in Mexico City and consequent water pollution, as well as the
        introduction of invasive species such as tilapia and perch. They are listed as
        critically endangered in the wild, with a decreasing population of around 50
        to 1,000 adult individuals, by the International Union for Conservation of
        Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and are listed under Appendix II of the
        Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Axolotls
        are used extensively in scientific research due to their ability to regenerate
        limbs, gills and parts of their eyes and brains. Axolotls were also sold as food
        in Mexican markets and were a staple in the Aztec diet.

      <animal:detail>
        Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-
        like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at
        right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults.
        All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order
        Urodela. Salamander diversity is highest in eastern North America, especially
        in the Appalachian Mountains; most species are found in the Holarctic realm,
        with some species present in the Neotropical realm. Salamanders rarely have
        more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some
        species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs. Their permeable skin
        usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp
        places. Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives,
        some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as
        adults. This group of amphibians is capable of regenerating lost limbs as well
        as other damaged parts of their bodies. Researchers hope to reverse engineer
        the regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as
        brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during
        heart surgery recovery. Members of the family Salamandridae are mostly
        known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies
        typical of other groups. The skin of some species contains the powerful
        poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have
        bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity. Salamanders typically lay
        eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their
        lifecycles. Some species in harsh environments reproduce while still in the
        larval state. (en)

        amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate
        orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction
        between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary
        history. An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached
        tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an
        extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with secretions
        ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-
        camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red
        or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live
        in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living
        underground or in trees. Frogs typically lay their eggs in water. The eggs
        hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills.
        They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous,
        omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they
        metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the
        tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of
        small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on plant
        matter. Frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health.
        Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass.
        They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web
        dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable,
        making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or
        have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide
        range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many
        different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators
        and to generally survive. Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have
        many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion. They are also seen as
        environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often viewed as
        early warning signs of environmental damage. Frog populations have
        declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are
        considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to
        have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among
        frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has
        spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand
        the causes of these problems and to resolve them. (en)

        "Hedyloidea"). Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago. Butterflies
        have a four-stage life cycle, as like most insects they undergo complete metamorphosis. Winged
        adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The
        caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When
        metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings
        have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several
        generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take
        several years to pass through their entire life cycle. Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many
        species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the
        monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites
        or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by
        other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops
        or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies
        (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists
        in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.
        The Smithsonian Institution says "butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature".

      <animal:comment>Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs
        generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk. They are the largest order of arachnids and
        rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on every
        continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat. As of August 2022,
        50,356 spider species in 132 families have been recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been debate among
        scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.

        Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with

        Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established
        in nearly every land habitat. As of August 2022, 50,356 spider species in 132 families have been
        recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should
        be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900. Anatomically, spiders
        (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused
        into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a
        small, cylindrical pedicel, however, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological
        evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the
        validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax. Similarly,
        arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains
        a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen. Unlike insects, spiders do not have
        antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized
        nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.
        Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by
        hydraulic pressure. Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude
        silk from up to six types of glands. Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky
        thread used. It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that
        produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders. Spider-like arachnids
        with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago, but these
        animals apparently lacked spinnerets. True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to
        299 million years ago, and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae.
        The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic
        period, before 200 million years ago.

      <animal:comment>Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short
        projecting "tail" (abdomen) (Greek: βραχύς, romanized: brachys = short, οὐρά / οura = tail), usually hidden
        entirely under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, are generally
        covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers. They first appeared during the Jurassic
        Period. </animal:comment>

      <animal:comment>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live
        throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even
        more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans

        Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the
        tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to
        include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
        Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa. Although they appear
        similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its
        narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles
        and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower
        and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious
        trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall
        along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an
        alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the
        crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw.
        For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species'
        family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to
        specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another
        trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression. Crocodile
        size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many similarities in
        these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as
        rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding
        mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs
        and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators, are
        very sensitive to cold. They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years
        ago. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.

        Monitor lizards are lizards in the genus Varanus, the only extant genus in the family Varanidae. They are native
        to Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and one species is also found in the Americas as an invasive species. About 80
        species are recognized. Monitor lizards have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. The
        adult length of extant species ranges from 20 cm (7.9 in) in some species, to over 3 m (10 ft) in the case of
        the Komodo dragon, though the extinct varanid known as megalania (Varanus priscus) may have been capable of
        reaching lengths more than 7 m (23 ft). Most monitor species are terrestrial, but arboreal and semiaquatic
        monitors are also known. While most monitor lizards are carnivorous, eating eggs, smaller reptiles, fish, birds,
        insects, and small mammals, some also eat fruit and vegetation, depending on where they live.
